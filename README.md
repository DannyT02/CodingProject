This is Quantum Physics Assignment of Sem 2 2025 for Foundation physics for EEE

This project aims to find Spectral Intensity of the sun and visible wave length emitted by the sun.

For integrating over visible light spectrum, I used For-loops to do so. There should be other method of integrating Planck's equation for better accuracy :)
